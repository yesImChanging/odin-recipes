    <h1>Chicken Karahi</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Karahi is named after the pan in which it was originally cooked – a heavy, often cast-iron pan that’s similar to a wok, but rounder with a flatter base. Traditionally, meat would be simmered and stir-fried in this karahi in an open fire.</p>
    <p>I’ve read in multiple places that karahi originates in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly Northwest Frontier) province of Pakistan, which makes sense given the cuisine’s heavy use of meat and black pepper.</p>
    <p>Chicken karahi’s distinguishing features are its rich, tomatoey base and a fragrant finishing of green chili peppers, cilantro, and slivers of ginger.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp ghee, See Note for dairy-free</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp neutral oil, or sub more ghee</li>
        <li>1 small (~150 g) onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>8 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>3/4 inch ginger, crushed</li>
        <li>1-2 Serrano or Thai green chili peppers, whole</li>
        <li>1-2 Serrano or Thai green chili peppers, whole</li>
        <li>2-2.2 lbs (~907 g) skinless, bone-in chicken, cut up into small pieces</li>
        <li>8 small (~600 g) tomatoes (I use Roma or Vine), diced</li>
        <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain whole-milk yogurt, whisked – See Note for dairy-free</li>
        <li>1 tsp black peppercorns, freshly ground, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2-3 green chili peppers, slit in half</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan over high heat, and add the ghee and oil. Once hot, add the onions and sauté for 5-6 minutes, or until lightly golden. Add garlic, ginger, and whole green chili pepper and sauté for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and ½ tsp salt and sauté for 5 minutes, or until the color of the chicken changes and it has stopped releasing water. Add the tomatoes, coriander, cumin, red chili pepper, and remaining salt and sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium, cover, and allow the chicken cook for 20 minutes, stirring once in between.</li>
        <li>Uncover and raise the heat to high. Sauté for 10 minutes to finish cooking the chicken and reduce excess liquid.* You will notice the chicken taking on a glossy appearance as the ghee/oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium, add in the whisked yogurt, and gently sauté for 2-3 minutes. Taste and add more salt, if needed. (I usually need another 1/8 tsp.) Add freshly ground black peppercorns and garam masala, and stir to combine. Top with green chili peppers, julienned ginger, and cilantro. Serve hot with roti, naan, bread, or rice.</li>
    </ol>
